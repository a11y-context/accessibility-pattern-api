# Navigation Drawer (Modal)

Pattern ID: `navigation-drawer.modal`

Panel that slides over the screen holding the app's destinations, behind a scrim. Material's `ModalNavigationDrawer` names the panel and gives it a dismiss action and a scrim that closes it, but leaves the screen behind in the accessibility tree and does nothing with focus or keys, so containing TalkBack and the keyboard, Escape, and moving focus in and back are the caller's.

## Use When
- Use when the app's destinations are too many for a navigation bar, or are secondary, and open in a panel from a menu button (e.g., "Inbox", "Sent", "Drafts", "Settings").

## Do Not Use When
- Do not use when three to five top-level destinations stay visible along the bottom (use `navigation-bar.basic`).
- Do not use when the panel stays on screen beside the content (use `navigation-drawer.persistent`).
- Do not use when the panel holds commands rather than destinations (use `menu.basic` or `bottom-sheet.modal`).

## Must Haves
- The drawer is modal: while it is open it is the only thing TalkBack and the keyboard can reach, it announces itself by name, and it closes from the back gesture, Escape, the scrim, and TalkBack's dismiss action. Material's `ModalNavigationDrawer` with a `ModalDrawerSheet` supplies part of this: the pane title "Navigation menu", a dismiss action while open, back handling, and a scrim that TalkBack reaches as a control named "Close navigation menu". It leaves the screen behind in the accessibility tree and has no focus or key handling (`global.native-first`).
- While the drawer is open, remove the screen's content from the accessibility tree with `Modifier.clearAndSetSemantics {}` on the content's outermost composable, applied only while open. The content is covered by the scrim and cannot be tapped, so hiding it hides nothing a user can reach; the scrim stays in the tree as the way out (`global.merge-semantics`).
- Keep keyboard focus inside the drawer while it is open, with `Modifier.focusProperties { onExit = { if (drawerState.isOpen) cancelFocusChange() } }` followed by `Modifier.focusGroup()` on the `ModalDrawerSheet` (`global.focus-management`).
- When the drawer opens, move keyboard focus to the current destination with a `FocusRequester` requested from a `LaunchedEffect` once the drawer is open. When it closes without a choice, return focus to the menu button that opened it (`global.focus-management`).
- When a destination is chosen, close the drawer and place focus on the new screen as `global.screen-announcement` describes, rather than returning it to the menu button.
- Close the drawer on Escape with `Modifier.onKeyEvent` on the `ModalDrawerSheet`. Material handles the back gesture and the back key and has no key handling of its own, the same gap `bottom-sheet.modal` closes for its sheet.
- Name the menu button that opens the drawer "Open navigation menu" on its `Icon`, the counterpart of Material's "Close navigation menu" on the scrim (`global.icon`).
- Build each destination with `NavigationDrawerItem`, which reports `Role.Tab` and a selected state, and put the items in a container with `Modifier.selectableGroup()` so each reports its position in the set (`global.collection-semantics`).
- Show the current destination by more than a hue change. `NavigationDrawerItem` fills a container behind it; when restyling, keep a visible fill or add a second marker such as a bolder label (`global.use-of-color`).
- Put a count on a destination as `badge.basic` describes, in words ("Inbox, 24 unread").

## Don'ts
- Do not leave the screen behind the open drawer in the accessibility tree. TalkBack swipes out of the drawer and into the screen it covers, and a keyboard Tabs out the same way without the focus containment above.
- Do not pass `gesturesEnabled = false` while the drawer is open. Material then ignores taps on the scrim as well as swipes, which takes away the plainest way out.
- Do not replace Material's scrim with a plain `Box`. The scrim is what carries "Close navigation menu" and the tap to close.
- Do not move focus back to the menu button after the user has chosen a destination. Focus belongs on the screen they asked for.

## Customizable
- The drawer may start with a header naming the app, and group its destinations into sections, each with a heading marked `heading()` (`global.headings`).
- An item may carry an icon beside its label, given `contentDescription = null` (`global.icon`).
- The drawer may open from the menu button only, with swipe gestures left enabled or not, provided the scrim and the back gesture still close it while it is open.

```kotlin

    var current by remember { mutableStateOf(destinations.first()) }
    val drawerState = rememberDrawerState(DrawerValue.Closed)
    val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
    val menuButtonFocus = remember { FocusRequester() }
    val currentItemFocus = remember { FocusRequester() }
    var returnFocusToMenu by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

    LaunchedEffect(drawerState.isOpen) {
        if (drawerState.isOpen) {
            currentItemFocus.requestFocus()
        } else if (returnFocusToMenu) {
            menuButtonFocus.requestFocus()
            returnFocusToMenu = false
        }
    }
