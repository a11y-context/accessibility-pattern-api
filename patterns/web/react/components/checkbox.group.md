# Checkbox Group

Pattern ID: `checkbox.group`

A set of related checkboxes that together answer one question. The group is named with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`, or `role="group"` with `aria-labelledby`, and each option is an independent native `<input type="checkbox">`.

Each option in the group is an individual checkbox that follows `checkbox.basic`; this pattern adds the group name and group-level validation a related set requires. For a single, self-sufficient checkbox, use `checkbox.basic`.

## Use When
- Use when several checkboxes together answer one question and each option's label is not meaningful without that shared question (e.g., "Which genres do you watch?" with "Action", "Comedy", "Drama").
- Use when the user may select zero, one, or many options from the set.
- Use when the set needs a single visible group label, and sometimes group-level validation (e.g., "Select at least one").

## Do Not Use When
- Do not use when a single, self-sufficient checkbox captures the choice (use `checkbox.basic`).
- Do not use when exactly one option may be selected from the set (use `radio.group`).
- Do not use when each toggle is a persistent setting that takes effect immediately rather than a value submitted with a form (use `switch.basic`).
- Do not use when the choices are presented inside a popup opened from a trigger (use `select.basic`, or a dedicated multi-select pattern for many values).

## Must Haves

### Group structure
- Wrap the related checkboxes in a single named group.
  - Preferred: a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>`. The `<legend>` text is the question the set answers and becomes the group's accessible name.
  - Alternative when `<legend>` cannot be laid out or styled as required: a container with `role="group"` and `aria-labelledby` pointing at the visible group-label element.
- The group label states the question or instruction for the whole set (e.g., "Which genres do you watch?"), not a generic heading.
- If a group-level instruction or constraint applies (e.g., "Select at least one"), associate it with the group using `aria-describedby` on the `<fieldset>` or `role="group"` container.

### Each option
- Each option is a native `<input type="checkbox">` (preferred) with a programmatically associated visible `<label>`. See `checkbox.basic` for the full per-control contract.
- Each option carries its own `checked` state; options are independent, and any number may be checked at once.
- Space toggles the focused option. Tab and Shift+Tab move between options, and each option is its own tab stop.
- Ensure a visible focus state (e.g., a 2px solid outline offset by 1-2px) around each option.

### Validation
- If the group is required (e.g., at least one selection), validate at the group level, never per option.
  - Indicate the requirement in the group's accessible name (e.g., append "(required)" to the `<legend>` or the `aria-labelledby` target), since a group has no native `required` attribute.
  - Provide one inline error container, placed after the group, that is present in the DOM at all times (empty until invalid), carries `aria-live="polite"`, and is referenced by the group container's `aria-describedby`. (`aria-describedby` is valid on both a `<fieldset>` and a `role="group"` element.)
  - Populate the error only when focus leaves the whole group with the requirement unmet, not as focus moves between options. Announcing an error each time the user tabs past an option would fire repeatedly.
  - While invalid, give the group a visible non-color indication (e.g., a red outline together with error text that begins with "Error:").
  - Do not move focus into or out of the group when the error appears. Submit-time focus handling is a form-level concern (see `form.error-summary`).

## Customizable
- The grouping mechanism: `<fieldset>` with `<legend>` (most robust), or `role="group"` with `aria-labelledby` (choose this when `<legend>` styling or layout is the blocker). Both convey the group name; pick one and verify with a screen reader.
- Per-option visual styling, using the same ladder as `checkbox.basic` (`accent-color`, `appearance: none`, or a visually hidden input with a painted box), as long as each input stays focusable and operable.
- Whether the options are laid out in a column, grid, or inline, as long as the reading and focus order is sensible.
- Whether a "Select all" affordance is offered. (A tri-state "Select all" that reflects a mix of checked children is `checkbox.tristate`.)

## Don'ts
- Do not rely on a nearby heading or paragraph to label the set without a programmatic association (a `<legend>`, or `aria-labelledby` on a `role="group"` container).
- Do not use `role="radiogroup"`, `role="radio"`, or arrow-key roving focus for checkboxes; checkboxes allow multiple selections, and each is a tab stop.
- Do not put `required` on every checkbox to express "select at least one"; native `required` forces that specific box to be checked. Validate at the group level instead.
- Do not attach a separate live-region error to each checkbox in a group; use one group-level error, announced once, so the user does not hear a string of errors while tabbing through the options.
- Do not wrap a single, self-sufficient checkbox in a `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` (that belongs to `checkbox.basic`).
- Do not combine unrelated questions in one group; one question per `<fieldset>` or `role="group"`.

## Golden Pattern

*Provisional. Pending AT verification.*

```jsx
"use client";

import * as React from "react";

const GENRES = [
  { value: "action", label: "Action" },
  { value: "comedy", label: "Comedy" },
  { value: "drama", label: "Drama" },
  { value: "documentary", label: "Documentary" },
];

const NOTIFY = [
  { value: "releases", label: "New releases" },
  { value: "price-drops", label: "Price drops" },
  { value: "recommendations", label: "Recommendations" },
];

export function CheckboxGroupDemo() {
  const [genres, setGenres] = React.useState([]);
  const [notify, setNotify] = React.useState(["releases"]);
  const [genresError, setGenresError] = React.useState("");

  function toggle(setList, value) {
    setList((list) =>
      list.includes(value)
        ? list.filter((v) => v !== value)
        : [...list, value]
    );
  }

  // Validate only when focus leaves the whole group, so the error is announced
  // once, not once per checkbox as the user tabs through. React's onBlur maps
  // to focusout, which bubbles.
  function onGenresBlur(e) {
    if (e.currentTarget.contains(e.relatedTarget)) return; // still inside the group
    setGenresError(
      genres.length === 0
        ? "Error: Choose at least one genre to continue."
        : ""
    );
  }

  return (
    <form noValidate>
      {/* Grouped with fieldset + legend (preferred) */}
      <fieldset
        aria-describedby={genresError ? "genres-hint genres-error" : "genres-hint"}
        onBlur={onGenresBlur}
      >
        <legend>Which genres do you watch? (required)</legend>
        <p id="genres-hint">Select at least one.</p>
        {GENRES.map((g) => (
          <div key={g.value}>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              id={`genre-${g.value}`}
              checked={genres.includes(g.value)}
              onChange={() => {
                toggle(setGenres, g.value);
                setGenresError("");
              }}
            />
            <label htmlFor={`genre-${g.value}`}>{g.label}</label>
          </div>
        ))}
      </fieldset>
      {/* One group-level error, placed AFTER the group; announced via aria-live. */}
      <p id="genres-error" aria-live="polite">
        {genresError}
      </p>

      {/* Grouped with role="group" + aria-labelledby (styling escape hatch) */}
      <div role="group" aria-labelledby="notify-label">
        <p id="notify-label">Notify me about</p>
        {NOTIFY.map((n) => (
          <div key={n.value}>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              id={`notify-${n.value}`}
              checked={notify.includes(n.value)}
              onChange={() => toggle(setNotify, n.value)}
            />
            <label htmlFor={`notify-${n.value}`}>{n.label}</label>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Acceptance Checks

Keyboard
- Tab moves focus to each option in turn; each checkbox is its own tab stop.
- Space toggles the focused option, and multiple options can be checked at once.
- Arrow keys do not move focus between options (this is not a radio group).
- A visible focus indicator is present on the focused option.

Screen Reader
- Entering the group announces the group name (the `<legend>` or the `aria-labelledby` target).
- Each option is announced with its own label, role ("checkbox"), and checked or unchecked state.
- A group-level instruction associated via `aria-describedby` is announced with the group.
- The `role="group"` set announces equivalently to the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` set.

Validation
- Moving focus out of the group with no option selected populates one group-level error, announced once via `aria-live="polite"` (not once per option as focus passes through).
- While invalid, the group shows a visible non-color indication, and returning to the group re-announces the error via `aria-describedby`.
- Focus is not moved when the error appears.
- Selecting an option clears the error.
